Sept/18/2017 Linked Lists.  This challenge only took about 30 minutes to solve and another 10 to code
up in VS. Brandon has done this challenge before so he started by whiteboarding the solution and then
had Tony and myself go over what he done and explain it back to him to make sure we understood what was
going on.
