Originally I used a method to do a .reverse but realized that it would be more beneficial
to really show how it would be reversed to show both my knowledge of built in tools like
System.Linq and and the longer way with logic shown how to come to the conclusion of the method used.
It took me about 45 minutes to work out the longer logic. The resources I used were Docs, online resources
and team members for this code challenge.
